## Our Mission: To Standardize and Modernize Cron Pattern Syntax

The `cron` utility is a cornerstone of task scheduling, but its syntax is fragmented across different systems. This GitHub organization aims to solve that problem by defining a standard for cron expressions.

### Our Initiatives

1.  **The Open Cron Pattern Specification (OCPS):** The core of our work. OCPS is a community-driven document that codifies existing cron behavior, resolves ambiguities, and introduces modern, portable features. **OCPS 1.0 is now released!**

2.  **Implementation-Agnostic Tools:** We also (could) host tools that help developers and users work with cron, regardless of the specific library or system they use. This could include projects like interactive pattern builders, validators, and educational resources.

Our goal is to create a reliable specification and a set of high-quality tools to foster a more interoperable and predictable cron ecosystem.

### How to Contribute

Contribution guidelines for the specification are available in the [OCPS readme](https://github.com/open-source-cron/ocps?tab=readme-ov-file#7-contributing).

General guidelines for the organization:

  * **Review** draft specifications and provide feedback. OCPS 1.0 is released; current focus is on future increments (1.1-1.4) available in the [ocps/increments](https://github.com/open-source-cron/ocps/tree/main/increments) directory.

  * **Raise** issues with ideas or ambiguities.

  * **Contribute** to our tools or propose a new one.

  * **Adopt** the standard in your own projects.

  * **Join us:** If you are the author of a cron library, request an invitation by opening an issue in the [OCPS repository](https://github.com/open-source-cron/ocps/issues/new). We encourage you to join us to collaborate more closely.
